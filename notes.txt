Somebody one told me the world was gonna roll me I aint the sharpest tool in the shed. She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb in the shape of an L, on her forehead. Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming, played to the rules and I hit the ground running. Didn't make sense not to live for fun, your brain gets smart, but your head gets dumb. So much to do, so much to see, so what's wrong with taking the back streets? You'll never know if you don't go. You'll never shine if you don't glow... Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go Play... hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on get paid... and all that glitters is gold... only sooting stars break the mo-o-old. It's a cool place, and they say it gets colder, you're bundled up now, wait 'till you get older, the meteor men beg to differ, judging by the hole in the satellite picture. The ice we skate, is getting pretty thin, the water's getting warm so you might as well swim. My world's on fire. How about yours? That's the way I like it and I never get bored.
